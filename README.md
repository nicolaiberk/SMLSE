# SMLSE
Supervised Machine Learning Similarity Estimate


The project is concerned with the measurement of rhetorical similarity of texts through supervised machine learning (SMLSE). This site contains the online appendix (see below) and reproducible code.

Each country has its own folder, which contains the code for [00] pre-processing, [02] producing the SMLSE, and [03] visualising the estimates. The German data contains additional files for [01] classifier selection, [04a] wordfish estimation, [04b] estimation of cosine and jaccard similarity, and [04c] visualisation of these estimates.
